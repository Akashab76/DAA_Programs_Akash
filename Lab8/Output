Enter the adjacency matrix for the graph (use -1 for INF):
Enter distance from vertex 0 to vertex 0: 0
Enter distance from vertex 0 to vertex 1: 5
Enter distance from vertex 0 to vertex 2: -1
Enter distance from vertex 0 to vertex 3: 10
Enter distance from vertex 1 to vertex 0: -1
Enter distance from vertex 1 to vertex 1: 0
Enter distance from vertex 1 to vertex 2: 3
Enter distance from vertex 1 to vertex 3: -1
Enter distance from vertex 2 to vertex 0: -1
Enter distance from vertex 2 to vertex 1: -1
Enter distance from vertex 2 to vertex 2: 0
Enter distance from vertex 2 to vertex 3: 1
Enter distance from vertex 3 to vertex 0: -1
Enter distance from vertex 3 to vertex 1: -1
Enter distance from vertex 3 to vertex 2: -1
Enter distance from vertex 3 to vertex 3: 0

Following matrix shows the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices:
0	5	8	7	
8	0	3	4	
7	8	0	1	
8	8	3	0
